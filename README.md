# 8-bit-binary-up-down-counter
A binary counter is a hardware circuit that is made out of a series of flip-flops. 
The output of one flip-flop is sent to the input of the next flip-flop in the series. Counters are used in many different applications these days. 
Some count up from zero and provide a change in state of output upon reaching a predetermined value; others count down from a preset value to zero to provide an output state change. However, some counters can operate in both up and down count mode, depending on the state of an up/down count mode input pin.  
A Binary Up/Down counter is a bidirectional counter capable of counting in either the up direction or the down direction. In this project, we have designed an 8-bit up/down counter which counts from 0 to 255 as an up counter and vice versa. LED interfacing is used to implement the counter.  
A push button switch is provided to decide whether to count up or down. The counter counts up when the button is pushed and vice versa.
